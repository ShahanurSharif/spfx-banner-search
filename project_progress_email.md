Subject: Monarch AI Search Project - Progress Update and Development Plan

Dear Team,

I'm writing to provide a comprehensive update on the Monarch AI Search project progress and outline our development plan moving forward.

## üéØ Project Overview
**Monarch AI Search** is a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part that provides an advanced banner-style search experience for SharePoint Online. The project integrates with PnP Modern Search for extensible search functionality and includes AI-enhanced search capabilities.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### Core Infrastructure
- **SPFx Web Part Foundation**: Successfully created a SharePoint Framework web part using SPFx version 1.21.1
- **Project Structure**: Established proper TypeScript/React architecture with modular component design
- **Dependencies**: Integrated all necessary packages including:
  - `@pnp/modern-search-extensibility` (v1.5.0) for search extensibility
  - `@fluentui/react` for modern UI components
  - `@microsoft/mgt-react` for Microsoft Graph integration
  - Essential SPFx libraries and development tools

### Main Components Implemented

#### 1. **SpfxBannerSearch Web Part** (`src/webparts/spfxBannerSearch/`)
- **Full-bleed hero banner design** with responsive layout
- **Configurable gradient backgrounds** with customizable start/end colors
- **Dynamic title support** with user property placeholders (`{displayname}`, `{email}`, etc.)
- **Floating circle animations** (optional, configurable)
- **Theme-aware styling** with CSS variables for dark/light mode support
- **Teams context integration** for Microsoft Teams compatibility

#### 2. **Search Functionality**
- **Dual search modes**: Regular search and AI-enhanced search
- **Dynamic data publishing** for search query integration with PnP Modern Search
- **Search suggestions** with keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, escape)
- **Click-outside-to-close** functionality for suggestions dropdown
- **Accessible design** with proper ARIA support

#### 3. **AI Search Component** (`AISearch.tsx`)
- **AI-specific search interface** with enhanced suggestions
- **Smart query filtering** and real-time suggestions
- **AI mode toggle** with visual indicators
- **Placeholder AI functionality** ready for AI service integration
- **Separate suggestion sets** for AI vs regular search

#### 4. **Property Pane Configuration**
