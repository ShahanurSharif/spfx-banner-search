- **Test with real users** to validate suggestion relevance

### Static Suggestions Format

‚úÖ Good: policy, procedure, training, safety, benefits
‚ùå Bad: policy documents, procedure manuals, training materials and courses
```

### Zero-term Suggestions
- **Limit to 3-5 items** for better user experience

- **Use action-oriented terms** like "help desk" rather than just "help"

### Performance Considerations
